            <h3>University College of Engineering Kakinada, JNTUK - Kakinada</h3>
            <p><i>Master of Technology in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, 2023-25</i></p>
            <p>During my master’s, I learned the true importance of presenting research through publications and the value it adds to our work.
              Being guided by professors with doctorates was incredibly inspiring and motivated me to pursue excellence.
              I also began working independently on my own project, which strengthened my confidence and problem-solving abilities.
              Volunteering for various events taught me lessons that went beyond academics—teamwork, communication, and adaptability.
              It was also my first hostel experience, which made me more independent and socially confident.</p>

            <p><i>Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering, 2019-23</i></p>
            <p>My bachelor’s was the phase where I truly started exploring and learning on my own.
              I built a strong foundation in computer science and realized the effort behind even the smallest technological detail.
              Serving as the Class Representative helped me understand my leadership abilities, identify my strengths and weaknesses, and develop confidence in managing responsibilities.
              It was a period of balancing academics with fun, learning to manage both studies and life’s little enjoyments.</p>

            <h3>Narayana Junior College - Gudivada</h3>
            <p><i>Intermediate in Mathematics Physics Chemistry, 2017-19</i></p>
            <p>This phase was all about discipline and persistence.
              With long study hours and constant pressure for marks, I often felt frustrated and realized how much the system focused on grades over understanding.
              It made me more determined to value real learning over rote memorization in the future.</p>

            <h3>Gandhi Municipal High School - Gudivada</h3>
            <p><i>From Class 7<sup>th</sup> to Class 10<sup>th</sup></i> </p>
            <p>These were the years of personal growth and self-awareness.
              I learned how to stay composed and responsible, even without direct guidance.
              I began understanding the importance of society, discipline, and self-control.</p>

            <p><i>From Kinder Garden to Class 6<sup>th</sup></i> </p>
            <p>From childhood to early teenage years, I lived with the belief that school was the entire world.
              This stage was full of innocence and early curiosity—where I first started to understand how the world works, even if through a narrow lens.
              It laid the foundation for my curiosity and eagerness to learn beyond boundaries later in life.</p>
